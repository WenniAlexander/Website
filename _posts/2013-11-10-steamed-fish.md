### Ingredients:

cod fish (2-3); salt & paper; spring onion (4-5 small ones); light soya sauce; oil

### Steps:

1. Put salt evenly on the fish (both side).
2. Put half of the spring onion slices on the steam plate.
3. Put the fish on top of the spring onion, then put the other half on the top of the fish.
4. A little bit of the cooking alcohol and paper on the top.
5. Place some water in the steamer and turn on the hob.
6. After the water boiled, put the fish plate in the steamer (the water cannot go over the plate, so if the plate is very shallow you can put a stand underneath).
7. Steam for 10-12 mins.
8. Turn off the hob, and put some light soya sauce on the fish.
9. Place hot oil on top of the fish, then you can dish up.


### Then enjoy!
